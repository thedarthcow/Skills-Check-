# HTML & CSS Project

In this project, you practice your HTML/CSS skills. 

You should see an `index.html`, `style.css` and `mockup.png` inside the `html-css-1` folder. Take a look at the `mockup.png` file. This is what you will be aiming to replicate. 

This practice set is meant to challenge you. Don't worry about making your page pixel perfect, but do try your hardest to get as close as you reasonably can. Also, you don't need to reuse the image of the elephant. You can replace it with any image you'd like. 

*Good luck!*
